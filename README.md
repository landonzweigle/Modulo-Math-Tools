# Modulo-Math-Tools
A set of tools for conveniently performing  common Modular Arithmetic. 

Many of these algorithms compute very important information for use in cryptography.

### Things I'd like to do (List may include more functions in the future):
- [X] Extended Euclidean Algorithm 
- [X] Implement Inverse
- [X] Fast Powers
- [ ] Creation of Latex Code
- [ ] Intuitive GUI
